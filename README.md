## React Stack of Cards

With this component you can:

1. Change Swipe Directions
2. Add a pagination
3. Change the number of cards visible

Things I learned from this small project:
1. Learn how to read js vanilla code and convert it to a framework
2. Git Source Control + Deployment to Heroku
3. React Hooks particulary (useState,useRef)
4. Using React to create animations and transitions
